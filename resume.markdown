## Employment History

### Betfair - December 2003 - September 2011
Betfair is the world’s largest betting exchange, processing more transactions than Europe’s stock exchanges combined. The majority of applications were written in java, running under tomcat or an inhouse container, running on CentOS 5 talking to Oracle databases.

#### Product Delivery & Support Technical Lead (June 2010 - September 2011)
Technical lead for Product Delivery across Platform and Enterprise systems including the core exchange and API systems as well as accounts and payments. Technical lead for the migration of main production data centre from London to Europe, achieved within a very tight timeframe and with very little downtime. Advocated a move towards a more devops-focussed culture culminating in the embedding of operations engineers among developers within delivery teams. Ensured that the needs of product delivery and support were voiced at architectural meetings

#### Platform Technical Lead (December 2009 – June 2010)
Documented and negotiated non functional requirements with development leads, and also documented requirements for monitoring and log analysis to allow IS to be able to support software that meets those non functional requirements. Made technical (and pragmatic) solution choices for monitoring (improving what we had) and chose Splunk as a new solution to our log analysis requirements. Attended architecture group meetings to ensure that the needs of the operations teams were voiced and understood.

#### Linux Senior Engineer (July 2008 – December 2009)

I was responsible for the people management of those in the Linux team, including appraisals, scoring, discipline etc. It was important to ensure that resourcing was properly carried out and that people were properly assigned to projects and releases. Technical responsibility such as signing off architectural designs rested with me. I left this role to move to a more technical position so that I could better use my skills to benefit the company.

#### Linux Systems Administrator (October 2004 – November 2006)
Supported an estate of around 500 production servers, including physical rackmounting and then kickstarting them, managing their configuration. Additionally there were many production application releases, many of which required zero downtime. Other elements of the role including setting up and responding to monitoring, automating tasks using a number of scripting languages, DNS updates etc.  

#### Production Operations Support (December 2003 – September 2004)
I started as a member of 24x7 production operations support team, where typical aspects of my role included monitoring, analyzing and escalating website issues, and performing investigations into bet disputes, market anomalies etc.

### Fujitsu - October 2000 - November 2003
